The culprit? A massive component re-rendering 10,000+ items on every state change.

Here's how I fixed it:

üîß **React.memo** - Prevented unnecessary re-renders
‚ö° **useMemo** - Memoized expensive calculations  
üì¶ **React.lazy** - Code-split heavy components
üéØ **useCallback** - Stabilized event handlers

Result: 3-second load time ‚Üí 0.8 seconds ‚ú®

6 months ago, I was struggling with basic DSA problems. Here's how I turned it around:

üìö **Structured Learning Path**:
- 3 months of DSA fundamentals (LeetCode Easy ‚Üí Medium)
- 2 months of system design basics
- 1 month of mock interviews and company-specific prep

üéØ **Daily Routine**:
- 2 hours coding practice (morning)
- 1 hour system design study (evening)
- Weekend mock interviews with seniors

üîë **Game Changers**:
- Consistent daily practice (no zero days)
- Focus on understanding patterns, not memorizing solutions
- Mock interviews with placement cell seniors

The Google interview had 4 rounds: 2 coding, 1 system design, 1 behavioral. The key was staying calm and thinking out loud.

To current students: Start early, stay consistent, and don't give up. Your dream company is waiting for you!

The beauty of Bellman-Ford:
- Handles negative weights gracefully
- Detects negative cycles
- O(V*E) complexity but guaranteed correctness

Key insight: Sometimes the "slower" algorithm is actually the right choice.

This reminded me that in DSA, understanding the constraints and edge cases is as important as knowing the algorithms themselves.

    example: `Most system design interviews are testing the wrong things.

Here's what's broken:

üéØ Interviewers expect candidates to know specific architectures by heart
‚è∞ 45 minutes isn't enough to design a real system
üìö Memorizing patterns ‚â† understanding trade-offs
üé™ No consideration for the candidate's background or experience level

The result? We're hiring people who can recite architectures, not people who can think critically about system design.

Here's what we should be testing instead:
ü§î Problem-solving approach
‚öñÔ∏è Trade-off analysis
üìä Scalability thinking
üîÑ Iterative improvement

System design is about thinking, not memorizing.

How can we make system design interviews more effective?

    prompt: `You are a senior engineer sharing a specific technical interview experience. Write a LinkedIn post about a challenging interview question and the lessons learned.

Requirements:
- Start with a time hook (like "During my Google interview, I was asked...")
- Focus specifically on INTERVIEW PREPARATION and technical interviews
- Mention specific interview types (coding, system design, behavioral)
- Include the actual question or problem you were asked
- Explain your thought process and approach
- Share what you learned about interview strategy
- Include preparation tips and resources
- Use interview-specific terminology (whiteboarding, pair programming, etc.)
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags (#InterviewPrep #CodingInterview #TechInterview #CareerGrowth #SoftwareEngineering)
- End with a question about others' interview experiences
- Keep it under 1300 characters

Focus on: Interview strategies, technical problem-solving, preparation techniques, interview mindset`,
    example: `During my Google interview, I was asked: "Design a system to handle 1 billion daily active users."

My first instinct was to jump into databases and load balancers. Big mistake.

The interviewer stopped me: "What questions would you ask first?"

That's when it clicked. System design interviews aren't about showing off your knowledge‚Äîthey're about demonstrating your thought process.

Here's what I learned:
ü§î **Ask clarifying questions first** - What are the core features? What's the scale?
üìä **Start with requirements** - Functional and non-functional
üèóÔ∏è **Begin simple, then scale** - Don't over-engineer from the start
üí¨ **Think out loud** - The interviewer wants to see your reasoning

I didn't get that job, but this experience transformed how I approach technical interviews.

What's the most valuable interview lesson you've learned?

    example: `After 50+ interviews, here are the 7 mistakes that cost me job offers:

üö´ Jumping straight to coding without clarifying requirements
üö´ Not asking clarifying questions about edge cases
üö´ Focusing on optimization before getting a working solution
üö´ Not explaining my thought process out loud
üö´ Forgetting to test my code with examples
üö´ Not preparing questions to ask the interviewer
üö´ Letting nerves affect my communication

The biggest lesson? Interviews are about problem-solving AND communication.

Here's what I do now:
‚úÖ Always start with clarifying questions
‚úÖ Think out loud, even if it feels awkward
‚úÖ Get a working solution first, optimize later
‚úÖ Practice explaining my code to others

    example: `After 100+ technical interviews, here are the 7 red flags that cost me job offers:

üö´ **Jumping to code without understanding the problem** - Always clarify requirements first
üö´ **Not testing my solution** - Walk through examples, catch edge cases
üö´ **Optimizing before getting a working solution** - Brute force first, optimize later
üö´ **Not communicating my thought process** - Think out loud, even if it feels awkward
üö´ **Forgetting to ask questions** - Show genuine interest in the role and company
üö´ **Not preparing for behavioral questions** - Have STAR method examples ready
üö´ **Giving up when stuck** - Ask for hints, show your problem-solving process

The biggest lesson? Interviews are about demonstrating your thinking process, not just getting the right answer.

Practice these fundamentals more than advanced algorithms.
