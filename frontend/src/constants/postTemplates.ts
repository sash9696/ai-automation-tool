    example: `Last month, I spent 3 days refactoring a React component that was 800 lines long.

The original code worked, but it was a nightmare to maintain. Every bug fix felt like playing Jenga with the entire component.

Here's what I learned:

üîß Break down large components into smaller, focused ones
üß™ Write tests BEFORE refactoring (saved me twice!)
üìö Document the "why" behind architectural decisions

The refactor reduced the component to 150 lines and made it 10x easier to debug.

But here's the real lesson: Technical debt isn't just about code quality‚Äîit's about team velocity and mental overhead.

What's the largest component you've ever refactored? What did you learn from it?

Here's the insight: Instead of checking every substring, we can build palindromes from the center outward.

The key learning? Sometimes the most elegant solutions come from looking at the problem differently.
